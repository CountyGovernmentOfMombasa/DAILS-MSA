Where the responsible Commission has a web application for filing the declaration, a public officer may</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">fill and submit the declaration online. In such a case, a physical signature or delivery acknowledgment slip</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">will not be necessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">2. The declaration is for the income, assets and liabilities of a public official, his spouse or spouses and his</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">dependent children under the age of 18 years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">3.

A person submitting a declaration or providing a clarification shall ensure that the declaration or</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">clarification is correct to the best of their knowledge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">10. If space on the form is not adequate, additional information may be included on separate sheets, while</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">clearly indicating the number and paragraph being continued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">11. For each form submitted, there will be an acknowledgment slip issued by the responsible Commission or</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">its agent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">12. Where a declaration is submitted electronically in accordance with the regulations made under this Act</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">or administrative procedures adopted by the responsible Commission or any other competent authority,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">the declaration shall be valid notwithstanding the absence of a signature or acknowledgement stamp or</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">receipt or slip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">13.
